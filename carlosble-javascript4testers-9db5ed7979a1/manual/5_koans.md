The koan metaphor has been borrowed in programming referring to an 
exercise that
consist in making broken tests pass, as a mean to learn a new programming language. 
You can find "koans" for many programming languages. The Ruby 
[ones](http://rubykoans.com/) are quite popular.

This is actually what we have been doing in previous exercises. We leave you now with
more "koans" to dig dipper into the JavaScript language:

>## Koans
>
> The tests in learnJavaScript/koans.js 
> do not pass, because the assertions are wrong. 
> Just by reading the tests, would you know what are the right assertions 
> for each test?
